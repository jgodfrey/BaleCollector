# BaleCollector
An arduino project created to automate a piece of homemade farming equipment (shown below). The project consists of a single Arduino Uno board, 6 relays, an LCD panel, and custom driver software (this repo).

The machine is designed to "collect" 10 square hay bales, configure them in a specific pattern that forms a square, and then eject that completed square onto the ground behind the machine. Later, multiple squares are stacked together to form a cube for storage or transport.

The Arudino was used to automate the entire process based on the feedback of various proximity switches indicating the current "state" of the machine. The mechanical devices on the machine controlled by the Arduino include a number of solenoid-driven hydraulic cylinders and pumps as well as an electric clutch.
